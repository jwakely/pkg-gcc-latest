# Binary packages for GCC snapshots

This page links to binary packages
built from recent [snapshots](https://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html)
of GCC's development trunk.
These builds are an experiment and might not get updated
and might even get taken down.

The latest snapshot is:

    GCC 9-20190310 Snapshot

    This snapshot has been generated from the GCC 9 SVN branch
    with the following options:
    svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk revision 269561

Packages for Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and openSUSE
are built and hosted in the
[jwakely/gcc-latest COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jwakely/gcc-latest/)

A package for Ubuntu 16.04 is hosted on my personal site (until I set up Git Large File Storage on GitHub):

- [gcc-latest_9.0.1-20190310svn269561.deb](http://kayari.org/gcc-latest_9.0.1-20190310svn269561.deb)

The script to create these packages is on [GitHub](https://github.com/jwakely/pkg-gcc-latest).
