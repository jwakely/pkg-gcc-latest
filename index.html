<h1>Binary packages for GCC snapshots</h1>

<p>This page links to binary packages
built from recent <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html">snapshots</a>
of GCC&rsquo;s development trunk.
These builds are provided for testing purposes,
but are an experiment and might not get updated
and might even get taken down.</p>

<p>Only the C and C++ compilers are included, in a single large package.
I don&rsquo;t intend to split them up into smaller packages,
because the aim is just to provide a testable compiler.</p>

<p>If you find bugs in GCC itself please report them to
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugs">GCC Bugzilla</a>
but for problems with how these packages are built
please use the
<a href="https://github.com/jwakely/pkg-gcc-latest/issues">GitHub issues tracker</a>.</p>

<p>You need to be aware that binaries created by this snapshot compiler
will not know how to find the <code>libstdc++.so.6</code> shared library by default.
This is because these packages install libraries to <code>/opt/gcc-latest/lib64</code>
and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html"><code>ld.so</code></a>
doesn&rsquo;t search in that directory by default.
This can be solved by using <code>LD_RUN_PATH</code> or <code>-Wl,-rpath</code> (when linking),
or <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (when running the executables),
or by creating static binaries that don&rsquo;t use <code>libstdc++.so.6</code> at all.
See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dynamic_or_shared.html#manual.intro.using.linkage.dynamic">Finding Dynamic or Shared Libraries</a>
in the libstdc++ manual for more details.</p>

<p>The latest snapshot is:</p>

<pre><code>  GCC 9-20190310 Snapshot

  This snapshot has been generated from the GCC 9 SVN branch
  with the following options:
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk revision 269561
</code></pre>

<p>Packages for Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and openSUSE
are built and hosted in the
<a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jwakely/gcc-latest/">jwakely/gcc-latest COPR</a>.</p>

<p>A package for Ubuntu 16.04 is hosted on my personal site (until I set up Git Large File Storage on GitHub):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kayari.org/gcc-latest_9.0.1-20190310svn269561.deb">gcc-latest_9.0.1-20190310svn269561.deb</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The sources for these packages can be found in the Subversion repository
(at the revision number above) or in the corresponding directory at
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/">https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/</a></p>

<p>The script to create these packages
is on <a href="https://github.com/jwakely/pkg-gcc-latest">GitHub</a>
(along with any patches applied to the upstream sources).</p>
