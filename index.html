Binary packages for GCC snapshots

<h1>Binary packages for GCC snapshots</h1>

<p>This page links to binary packages for some popular GNU/Linux distributions,
built from recent <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html">snapshots</a>
of GCC&rsquo;s development trunk.
These builds are provided for testing purposes,
but are an experiment and might not get updated
and might even get taken down.</p>

<p>Only the C and C++ compilers are included, in a single large package.
I don&rsquo;t intend to split them up into smaller packages,
because the aim is just to provide a testable compiler.</p>

<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>

<p>If you find bugs in GCC itself please report them to
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugs">GCC Bugzilla</a>
but for problems with how these packages are built
please use the
<a href="https://github.com/jwakely/pkg-gcc-latest/issues">GitHub issues tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<h3>Experimental and potentially unstable</h3>

<p>These packages are provided to make it easier for people to try out
the latest GCC code (e.g. in Travis CI) but are not supported,
neither by the GCC project nor by me.
Please test your code with them and provide feedback
(e.g. if you have valid code that no longer compiles,
or runs slower, or faster!)
but don&rsquo;t rely on these packages for your production builds.</p>

<p>For serious purposes you should use supported packages
provided by your linux distribution vendor,
or make your own builds of GCC and support them yourself.</p>

<h3>Dynamic linking</h3>

<p>You need to be aware that binaries created by this snapshot compiler
will not know how to find the <code>libstdc++.so.6</code> shared library by default.
This can result in errors complaining about <code>GLIBCXX_3.4.26</code> not being found.
This is because these packages install libraries to <code>/opt/gcc-latest/lib64</code>
and <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html"><code>ld.so</code></a>
doesn&rsquo;t search in that directory by default.
This can be solved by using <code>LD_RUN_PATH</code> or <code>-Wl,-rpath</code> (when linking),
or <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (when running the executables),
or by using <code>-static</code> to create static binaries that don&rsquo;t depend on
<code>libstdc++.so.6</code> at all.
See <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dynamic_or_shared.html#manual.intro.using.linkage.dynamic">Finding Dynamic or Shared Libraries</a>
in the libstdc++ manual for more details.</p>

<h3>Checking enabled</h3>

<p>GCC pre-release snapshots have lots of additional checking enabled
in the compiler, which slows the compiler down considerably.
Please do not report problems with slow compile times using these packages,
unless you&rsquo;re comparing apples to apples
(e.g. comparing to another pre-release build with checking enabled).</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>

<p>The latest snapshot is:</p>

<pre><code>  GCC 9-20190317 Snapshot

  This snapshot has been generated from the GCC 9 SVN branch
  with the following options:
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk revision 269746
</code></pre>

<p>RPM packages for <strong>Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, and openSUSE</strong>
are built and hosted in the
<a href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/jwakely/gcc-latest/">jwakely/gcc-latest COPR</a>.</p>

<p>A <code>.deb</code> package for <strong>Ubuntu 16.04</strong> is hosted on my personal site
(because large binaries can&rsquo;t be stored in a GitHub repo):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://kayari.org/gcc-latest/gcc-latest.deb">gcc-latest_9.0.1-20190317svn269746.deb</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>The sources for these packages can be found in the Subversion repository
(at the revision number above) or in the corresponding directory at
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/">https://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/</a></p>

<p>The script to create these packages
is on <a href="https://github.com/jwakely/pkg-gcc-latest">GitHub</a>
